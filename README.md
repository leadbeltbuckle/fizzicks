This project aims to develop a physics engine.
Currently, the code operates in 3-D cartesian coordinates.
Goals include expanding to operate in radial coordinates, as well as n-dimensional space.

classes.py contains the initial framework for all linear algebra operations,
as well as the beginning of a class representing physical objects.
